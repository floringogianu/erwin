# Do BNNs suffer from warm-up?

## Installation

Until we test that creating conda envs from `environment.yaml` works properly
I will leave here installation instructions for non-obvious packages.

```sh
conda install termcolor
pip install git+git://github.com/tudor-berariu/liftoff.git#egg=liftoff
```
